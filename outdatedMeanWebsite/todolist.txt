to do list:

1 - make static data of all users
    JSON format - array of all users and their info

2 - instead of loading in data from static json, we do a get request from the database
    load into database(do only once)

3 - add to users table: User is being added to database(register/login)
  = modify mentors & mentees

3 - dynamically load data into the database 
    profile. Activate mentor status - profile page .. load data .. gets put into the database
        So then... when we pull from database.. it'll be real time data and dynamic
