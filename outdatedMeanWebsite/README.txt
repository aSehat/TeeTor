To run server, first start mondogb by locating it in file directory. For example, C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.2\bin\mongo.exe. Then, run
server itself by typing "node server.js" in command prompt or "npm run devStart" if nodemon is installed. To access the website, go to localhost:3000 
in web brower.
